If for some reason you just want to use plain FTP, you can do the following to install it. (I highly recommend you stick to SFTP as it much more secure, especially if you plan on allowing internet access).
1. Using SSH or the terminal on the Pi enter the following commands.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install vsftpd

2. Now open up the config file by entering the following command:
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf

3. In here add or uncomment(Remove the #) for the following settings.
anonymous_enable=NO
local_enable=YES
write_enable=YES
local_umask=022
chroot_local_user=YES
user_sub_token=$USER
local_root=/home/$USER/ftp

4. Once you are done press ctrl+x and then y to save and exit.
 
5. Now we need to create the FTP directory so we can transfer files. The root directory is not allowed to have write permissions so we will need a sub folder called files. If you try to copy to FTP it wonâ€™t work but FTP/files will. Replace <user> with the relevant user, for example
mkdir /home/<user>/FTP
mkdir /home/<user>/FTP/files
chmod a-w /home/<user>/ftp

6. Now restart the service by entering the following command:
sudo service vsftpd restart

7. You should now be able to connect over plain FTP (Port 21).
